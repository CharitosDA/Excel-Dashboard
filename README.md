**Interactive Debt Management System: Insights into Client Payment Behaviors and Overdue Balances**
Project Overview
This Interactive Debt Management System was developed to address common challenges faced by our team in managing and tracking overdue accounts receivable. The primary objective was to create an efficient, user-friendly dashboard that provides instant insights into client debts, enabling faster decision-making and enhanced monitoring.

**Data Collection and Preparation**
I initiated the project by creating a custom dataset tailored to the specific needs and daily issues encountered by our team. This dataset was meticulously structured to encapsulate key elements of our clients' debt-related information, enabling a comprehensive analysis of payment behaviors and overdue statuses.

**Dashboard Design and Features**
The dashboard harnesses the power of Excelâ€™s pivot tables to dynamically respond to user interactions, offering detailed insights within two clicks. Here are the main features of the dashboard:

Top 10 Debtors by Quarter: This feature provides a quarterly breakdown of the top 10 clients with overdue debts. It allows team members to quickly identify and focus efforts on the highest priority accounts.
Monthly Debt Trends: By analyzing how debts evolve on a monthly basis, this feature categorizes debts according to type and payment patterns. It offers a deeper understanding of how different clients settle their liabilities and which debt types are most problematic.
Interactive User Interface: The dashboard is designed with user interactivity at its core. Simple mouse hovers and clicks reveal detailed data points, making it incredibly easy to navigate and extract needed information without navigating through complex reports.
Applications and Benefits
This dashboard serves as a crucial tool for our finance team, enabling them to:

Identify critical debt issues swiftly, prioritize client accounts for follow-up, and optimize debt collection strategies.
Gain historical insights into debt patterns, enhancing predictive analyses and future decision-making.
Enhance reporting efficiency and reduce the workload related to manual data manipulation and analysis.

**Conclusion**
The Interactive Debt Management System is more than just a reporting tool; it is a comprehensive solution that empowers our team to manage client debts more effectively and proactively. By integrating this dashboard into our daily operations, we can maintain a healthier cash flow and build stronger relationships with our clients through better understanding and managing their payment behaviors.
